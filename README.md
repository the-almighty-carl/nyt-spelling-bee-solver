# nyt-spelling-bee-solver
Quick and dirty Python script that solves Frank Longo's spelling bee puzzles from the New York Times magazine.

Useful if you don't have the answer page with you.


Installation:
    Take main.py and words.txt and put them in a folder where you'll remember them. Would just make a folder myself but GitHub hates me.
    Also you need Python or something.
